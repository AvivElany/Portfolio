_בודק יקר ברוך הבא לפרויקט הפורטפוליו שלי - סוף מודול ג'אווהסקריפט_

## לפניך מובא סיפור הדרך של הפרויקט:

## Main Page
- HTML and CSS page made after creative work on the page and what I want to show about myself.
- All the sections are responsive to the size of the viewing screen at that moment and are not affected by constant jumps of a PC, tablet and/or mobile.
- A fixed navbar with valid and relevant links, an icon image that also appears in Hero and a designed opening section.
- [about] General background about myself and what my ambitions are.
- [skills] Background in languages and frameworks that I have learned over time so far (when I learned C in a different place).
- [contact] Contact form that responds and saves details in local storage. We have not yet learned how he actually sends a message.
- The page was built during the module and I intend to cultivate it more and more.

## The sections of the projects:
- I built an external file called data.json that contains all the relevant information throughout the use that contains title, description, a thumbnail, the same technologies that every project is built from.
- both for the JavaScript project and for the HTML&CSS project.
- On the main page, fetch pulls all the data and creates an HTML page with a completely identical design (in one function).
- An external page is designed using the id sent for it in the URL and knows how to draw the requested project from the database and display it in a general way instead of building a page for each project

## Tech

I used several technologies within the current project:

- [HTML] - The most basic language for writing the website page.
- [CSS] - For the design of the HTML pages.
- [BootsTrap] - In favor of a complete website design, mainly to not design too much.
- [SASS] - When the project is long and complicated, it must be divided into several sections - so it is with the website design.
- [Javascript] - The main project topic. To perform operations of displaying information to the user, taking information from a database and printing on the screen, processing data behind the scenes, using buttons and more.
- [Visual Studio Code]
